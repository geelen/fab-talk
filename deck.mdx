## RUNTIME

Includes delivery

```notes
This is somewhat unique to web apps.
It's not always that important, but it usually is.
There are other platforms where delivery is important, but not in the same way.
```

### Part One
# Beyond Static Rendering

```notes
Now, look at this graph. I'm not prepared enough to actually run this section as a demo so I'm going to point at this thing and try to get you to imagine what's going on.

Let's think about what this graph means. We can see we have an initial period of waiting, then the HTML content is on the screen, then we go off and load the JS, and then we render it locally.

In development, that works great. We have a powerful computer and an instantaneous network. We also have live-reload, so we don't have to spend much time here.

But in production, this process is one of the most important things to optimise.
```

```notes
By default, using something like React that wants to be 100% client-rendered, you usually send down a blank HTML page. Then the JS boots and the app works.

Who here deploys an app like this? Most of the time you're writing a product that requires sign-in, where people will be spending all day there, that sort of thing.

There's nothing wrong with this approach, but it doesn't suit all use cases.

### Part Two
# Hosting Dynamic Frontend Apps

---

# Hosting Static Apps

* Simple
* Portable
* Can't really fail<br/>(You can still ship broken code tho)
* Scalable
* Efficient

```notes
We can get all these for dynamic too
```

---

# Host your own?

* Simple 🤷‍♂️
* Portable 🤗
* Can't really fail ❌
* Scalable 😬
* Efficient 😬

---

# "Serverless"

* Simple 🤷‍♂️
* Portable 🤗
* Can't really fail 🤗
* Scalable 🤗
* Efficient ❌

---

```notes
- Static is super easy
- Cache + invalidate
- Static + Serverless is the "cool thing" (fire it's the hot thing)
- Lambdas no bueno for frontend apps critical path. Good for APIs
```

---

# We want the benefits of serverless but on a platform fast enough to serve everything
