#### <br/>The Docker of Frontend

```notes
Hands up if:
- You vaguely know what docker is
- You use it day-to-day
- You really understand it

Now, for those people with their hands still up, you lnow docker a lot better than me. I'm definitely no expert, so if I get some details wrong I apologise, the analogy isn't perfect but I think it works well enough.

### There were _shipping containers_<br/>before the _Intermodal Container_

```
Good boxes, too! 
```

---

### There were _software containers_<br/>before _Docker_

```notes
We just called them Virtual Machines. And lots of companies like Heroku or AWS or VMWare were doing really clever things with their platforms, lots of the same things you can do these days, but Docker was different.
```

## Why were _these_ successful?

## Why were _these_ successful?

### â€¢ Fit-for-purpose
### â€¢ Open-source
### â€¢ Platform-agnostic
### â€¢ Timely

```notes
Talk about how both intermodal containers and docker match these.

ICs were well-designed, but the crucial aspect was that the patents were given away to industry, effectively making them open source, so anyone can use them. They were designed to work with anyone's trucks, anyone's ships, and they came just at the right time as the world was changing after world war 2.

Docker was much more restrictive, the images were dozens or hundreds of megabytes instead of multiple gigs, but the big thing was that it ran everywhere, you weren't locked into any particular hosting platform to make use of this new architecture.
```

## What _FABs_ aim to do:

### â€¢ Fit-for-purpose
### â€¢ Platform-agnostic
### â€¢ Open-source
### â€¢ Timely

```notes
I'm going to come back to platform-agnostic at the end but I've been here talking X minutes so I think it's probably time to talk about FABs themselves, hey?

I don't have time to go into much detail, obviously the open-source bit is somewhat of a given, I'll just focus on the first one for the moment.

## Deploying a frontend app in 2019:
### â€¢ Use an existing container format
### â€¢ Go static only

## Frontend is a <br/>_smaller concern_

## Static hosting

## "Static" hosting

* Static assets
* HTTP Headers
* Redirects
* API proxying
