### The Docker of Frontend

```notes
Hands up if:
- You vaguely know what docker is
- You use it day-to-day
- You really understand it

Now, for those people with their hands still up, you lnow docker a lot better than me. I'm definitely no expert, so if I get some details wrong I apologise, the analogy isn't perfect but I think it works well enough.

## Frontend is a <br/>_smaller concern_

## What Frontend _needs_

HTTP in/out

Low latency

Scalability

```notes
This isn't what all frontend apps need, but a frontend container standard needs 
```

---

## Static hosting?

---

## Static hosting

HTTP in/out ❌

Low latency ✅

Scalability ✅

## HTTP in/out

HTTP Headers

Redirects

##### Frontend Application Bundle

```sh
fab.zip
  ├── server.js   (server entry point)
  └── _assets     (directory of assets for this release)
```

---

##### server.js

```js
export function getProdSettings() {
  return {
    API_URL: "https://api.example.com",
    CLIENT_ID: "1cd5e6a4871f98616a38abb2eada56868ca5aad2"
  }
}

export async function render(request, settings) {
  return new Response(/* ... */)
}
```

---

### FAB Fact #1

## Production settings are baked in

(so the FAB is portable)

---

```js
export function getProdSettings() { /*...*/ }

export async function render(request, settings) {
  // request: a fetch.Request object
  // settings: production settings plus overrides
  
  const { body, statusCode, headers } = 
             await myApp.render(request, settings)
  
  // return a fetch.Response object with the full data.
  return new Response(body, { statusCode, headers })
}
```

---

### FAB Fact #2

## Render function called on every request

(with settings injected)

---

##### _assets

```text
_assets            (served under /_assets)
  ├── js
  │   ├── main.7fcd9566.js
  │   └── ...      (fingerprinted, immutable)
  │   ...
  └── _public
      ├── favicon.e925f90a.ico
      └── ...      (auto-fingerprinted, rewrite
                    rule added for /favicon.ico)
  ```

---

### FAB Fact #3

## `/_assets` is a special path

(but you don't have to worry too much about it)

---

##### NPM Packages

```text
Compilers:
@fab/static - compile a FAB from a static dir
@fab/nextjs - compile a NextJS v8 project
@fab/afterjs - compile a AfterJS project
@fab/compile - used internally by the above

Runners:
@fab/serve - run a FAB in a NodeJS express server
@fab/cf-workers - deploy FAB to a Cloudflare Worker
@fab/lambda-edge - deploy FAB to Lambda@Edge
```

---

### FAB Fact #4

## You don't need to know how FABs work

(just use the compiler for your current project)

---

## Development Status

* FAB compilers
  * `@fab/static` released & documented
  * `@fab/nextjs` working, in active development
  * `@fab/afterjs` needs updating


* FAB deployers
  * `@fab/serve` no environments, not production ready
  * `@fab/cf-workers` Linc only, not yet open-sourced
  * `@fab/lambda-edge` Linc only, not yet open-sourced

---

## Frontend needs to <br/>_move faster_

## _Innovation_

---

## _Linc roadmap_

* Preview links per commit &nbsp;✅
* Instant releases on PR merge &nbsp;✅
* Blue/green deployments
* Canary deployments
* A/B testing between FABs
* Performance testing each commit
* Visual regression testing
* Parallel acceptance testing
* Smoke testing against production backends
