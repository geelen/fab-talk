### The Docker of Frontend

```notes
Hands up if:
- You vaguely know what docker is
- You use it day-to-day
- You really understand it

Now, for those people with their hands still up, you lnow docker a lot better than me. I'm definitely no expert, so if I get some details wrong I apologise, the analogy isn't perfect but I think it works well enough.

## Docker was _smaller_

Virtual Machine: ~GBs

Docker Image: ~100s MBs

### Docker was _better,_ but that's not why it's been so successful

## What about FABs?

## Deploying a frontend app in 2019:
### â€¢ Use an existing container format
### â€¢ Go static only

## Frontend is a <br/>_smaller concern_

## Static hosting

## "Static" hosting

* Static assets
* HTTP Headers
* Redirects
* API proxying
